A Slack Application that identifies and corrects unconscious gender bias in messages and conversations

# Introduction
The BiasCorrect Plug-In helps organizations and individuals fight unconscious gender bias by making a conscious choice and become a catalyst for change.

The BiasCorrect Plug-In is designed to help users fight their unconscious gender bias in the workplace, by flagging it to them during real-time chat conversations so they can make a conscious choice to become a catalyst for change.

Words are a powerful thing. Everyday people across the globe send seemingly harmless messages in which female and male leaders are described very differently. These harmless exchanges are full of unconscious gender biases that fuel the gender gap. Gender biases so ingrained in even the most progressive of us that sometimes our word choices are automatic.
